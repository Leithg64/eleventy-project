### using the site.json static date include from \_data

- hello world site

- Test site

### rendering holiday object as json with the json filter inside a `<pre>` tag

<pre>

[{"title":"Christmas","date":"25/12"},{"title":"Boxing Day","date":"26/12"},{"title":"New Years Day","date":"1/1"}]

</pre>

### use a for loop to [iterate](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/iteration/) over the holidays in the site.json static data

---



Christmas




Boxing Day




New Years Day




### The for loop iterates over holidays in site and rendering the title snd date into specified table data tags. An alternate option would be the [tablerow](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/iteration/#tablerow) iteration loop

---

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Title:</th>
    <th>Date:</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Christmas</td>
    <td>25/12</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Boxing Day</td>
    <td>26/12</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>New Years Day</td>
    <td>1/1</td>
  </tr>

</table>

### now... use the data from https://www.api.gov.uk/gds/bank-holidays/#bank-holidays https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json using the same approach as the testData.mjs example

#### start simple, render the whole lot .json

#### get fancy, make a table

#### copy this https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays style (will need code to split into years)

#### show off and use some nice css framework for a .... -->
